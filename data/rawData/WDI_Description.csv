"6 May, 2014: Purchasing power parity (PPP) indicators have been revised based on the 2011 International Comparison Program (ICP) estimates released on April 30, 2014. Annual estimates from OECD and Eurostat have previously appeared in the WDI database; for other countries annual estimates are derived from the 2011 benchmark year through a simple extrapolation method that applies the relative rate of inflation observed in the country compared with the United States to the base year PPP estimates. Extrapolation for the GDP conversion factor uses the GDP implicit deflator. Extrapolation for private consumption uses the consumer price index. PPP data are now provided only from 1990, as the longer the time period between the estimate and the benchmark, the greater the risk of inaccuracy. This database update also features revised estimates for maternal mortality indicators from 1990 to 2013 from the Maternal Mortality Estimation Inter-Agency Group; revised life expectancy figures for Kazakhstan; updates for health expenditure and cause of death series; revised estimates for adjusted savings indicators; refined exchange rate and U.S. dollar conversions for euro area countries, along with corrections for Belarus, Estonia, Singapore and Republic of Yemen; revised national accounts data for Ethiopia and GNI corrections for Chad; corrected PM10 and metals depletion data for adjusted savings indicators; and national accounts revisions for Nigeria based on official government statistics released on 6 April, 2014.

Corrections have been made to constant price and purchasing power parity data for Armenia; constant price expenditure data for Nicaragua; and CO2 data for Palau. Constant price GDP and CPI data that are officially reported  by the National Statistics and Censuses Institute of Argentina have be restored. The International Monetary Fund has, however, issued a declaration of censure and called on Argentina to adopt remedial measures to address the quality of the official GDP and CPI data. Alternative data sources have shown significantly lower real growth and higher inflation than the official data since 2008. In this context, the World Bank is also using alternative data sources and estimates for the surveillance of macroeconomic developments in Argentina.
